# Critical CVE Blocker Pack

**Stop shipping known vulnerabilities to production.**

## 🛑 The Pain Point
Modern software supply chains are complex. A single dependency update can introduce a "Critical" vulnerability (CVSS 9.0+) that exposes your entire platform to remote code execution (RCE). Manually checking scan reports is slow and error-prone.

## ✅ The Solution
This Paygod pack integrates with container scanners (like Trivy, Grype, or Clair) to enforce a hard quality gate on your release pipeline.

### Policy Logic
- **DENY:** If any vulnerability has `cvss_score >= 9.0` AND status is NOT `fixed`.
- **WARN:** If any vulnerability has `7.0 <= cvss_score < 9.0` (High severity).
- **ALLOW:** If only Medium/Low vulnerabilities exist, or if Criticals are marked as `fixed` (false positives handled via exemptions).

## 🛠️ Integration
Pipe your scanner's JSON output into this pack during your CI/CD build step.

```yaml
# Example Input
scan_report:
  artifact_name: "payment-service:v1.2.3"
  vulnerabilities:
    - cve_id: "CVE-2023-1234"
      severity: "CRITICAL"
      cvss_score: 9.8
      status: "active" # ❌ This triggers a DENY
```

## 📉 ROI & Business Value
- **Automated Security Gate:** No more "I forgot to check the scan."
- **Brand Protection:** Prevent embarrassing and costly breaches caused by known exploits.
- **Developer Feedback:** Immediate feedback in the PR/Commit stage, shifting security left.
