# Paygod Trademark Policy

This policy describes the conditions under which you may use the "Paygod" name and logo.

## 1. The Basics
*   **"Paygod"** and the Paygod Logo are trademarks of Paygod, Inc.
*   We want you to use the name to refer to the project, distribute the open source code, and build community.
*   We **do not** want you to use the name in a way that confuses users about the origin of the software or implies official endorsement where none exists.

## 2. Permitted Uses (No Permission Needed)
*   **Referring to the Project:** "I am using Paygod for compliance."
*   **Distributing Unmodified Binaries:** Redistributing the official release binaries.
*   **Community Packs:** "Security Pack for Paygod" (naming your pack).

## 3. Restricted Uses (Permission Required)
*   **Commercial Hosting:** You may **NOT** use the "Paygod" name or logo to sell a hosted SaaS version of the software (e.g., "Paygod Cloud by MyCorp"). You must use your own brand (e.g., "MyCorp Compliance Service, powered by Paygod").
*   **Modified Versions:** If you fork the code and make significant changes, you should call it something else (e.g., "MyFork, based on Paygod").

## 4. Logo Usage
*   Do not alter the colors or proportions of the logo.
*   Do not combine it with your own logo in a way that implies a partnership.
